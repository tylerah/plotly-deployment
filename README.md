# Belly Button Biodiversity Visualized Using JavaScript and HTML
The live dashboard can be accessed using the following link: https://tylerah.github.io/plotly-deployment/
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage that is capable of visualizing data regarding bacterial cultures sampled from the navels of volunteer test subjects. The webpage serves as a convenient dashboard where volunteers can view the data summarizing the bacterial cultures sampled from their own navel as well as that pertaining to other test subjects. This visualization was created using a combination of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and d3 Listeners. 

## Description of the Visualization
The data analysis included information regarding the total number of bacterial cultures retrieved from each test subject as well as information regarding how frequently they wash their own navels. When the drop-down menu is used select a Test Subject ID No., three graphs are displayed. The first graph is a bar chart that shows the top 10 most frequently observed bacterial cultures for that individual. The second graph is a "gauge" graph that shows how frequently that individual washes their own belly button. The final graph is a bubble chart that shows the relative frequency of each bacterial species found in each subject. In addition, there is a small information box that displays the demographic information of that test subject.
